## Product Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### Phase 1 — User Experience Improvements
- Simple web or mobile interfaces
- Clear intake history visualization
- Improved alert visibility
- Flexible threshold configuration

### Phase 2 — Multi-Patient & Data Export
- Multiple patients per caregiver
- Treatment history per patient
- Data export (CSV / PDF)
- Incident logging

### Phase 3 — Analytics & Notifications
- Adherence rate analytics
- Estimated remaining treatment duration
- Advanced notification rules
- Pattern detection for missed intakes

### Phase 4 — Long-Term Prescribed Medication Management (Home Care)

This phase explicitly goes beyond the MVP scope.

While the MVP validates core business rules
(stock integrity, intake confirmation, and alerting)
in a controlled and simplified treatment context,
this phase addresses real-life, long-term prescribed medication
management in home-care conditions.

Key differences from the MVP include:
- frequent prescription changes (dosage adjustments, additions, removals)
- multiple concurrent treatments
- long-term tracking over months or years
- historical traceability of treatment changes
- advanced reminder orchestration

This phase introduces **anticipatory reminders**,
including a configurable alarm triggered **10 minutes before a scheduled intake**,
designed to support patients in real-life daily routines
and reduce missed intakes before they occur.

This functionality is intentionally excluded from the MVP
to preserve validation focus and is introduced only
after the core engine has proven reliable.
