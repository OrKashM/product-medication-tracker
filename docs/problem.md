## Problem

Patients following long-term or recurring treatments often face difficulties
in consistently taking their medication as prescribed.
Missed intakes, confusion around schedules, and poor visibility on remaining stock
are common issues, especially in home-care contexts.

This problem affects not only patients, but also people responsible for monitoring
their treatment (family members, close relatives, caregivers), who often lack
reliable tools to track adherence and anticipate stock shortages.

Most existing solutions are either too complex, medically oriented,
or not adapted to real-life daily usage.
As a result, preventable treatment interruptions and stress situations occur.

Addressing this problem is critical to improve treatment adherence,
reduce avoidable risks, and lower the cognitive load on both patients
and accompanying caregivers.
